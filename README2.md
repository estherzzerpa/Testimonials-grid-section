<h1>Practice GRID'S and responsive! </h1>
![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

It was a challenge to do this project to practice the grids, it helped me to focus on the structure and find the best way I could think of to be able to fulfill the objective.
The responsive part more than anything made it more difficult for me, but always looking for the solution.

I hope some feedback, so I can improve my code!
